# data_analysis_portfolio

Hello! My name is Julia and I recently graduated with a master's in Biological Sciences, specialising in computational ecology. 

This repository has an example of my data analysis work. This project was originally completed during the final year of my undergraduate degree. Since then, I have revisited the dataset and analysis, applying the stronger coding practices, analytical techniques, and visual communication skills Iâ€™ve developed during my master's and since graduating.

_Data Wrangling_: Data cleaning, missing value handling, type conversions

_Exploratory Data Analysis_: Visual exploration
